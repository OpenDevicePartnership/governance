**Proposed term:** Jan–Dec 2026

**Primary focus area(s):**  
- Secure platform firmware & UEFI architecture  
- EC firmware & OS–EC service interfaces  
- Memory-safe firmware adoption  
- Supply-chain security & attestation  
- Industry standards, governance & partner engagement

## Professional Background

Thorsten Stremlau is a Systems Principal Architect at NVIDIA with extensive experience spanning platform firmware, secure boot architectures, and industry-scale device manageability solutions. His work sits at the intersection of UEFI (EDK2), Embedded Controller (EC) firmware, Out-of-Band (OOB) manageability, and standards-based remote management frameworks such as DMTF Redfish, with particular focus on Windows on ARM and heterogeneous client platforms.

Thorsten has led cross-layer architecture efforts covering UEFI runtime services, EC telemetry, OS–firmware service boundaries, SMBIOS, ACPI, and secure provisioning flows. A recurring theme in his work is translating abstract security and manageability requirements into deployable, OEM-viable architectures that balance robustness, longevity, and real-world constraints.

In parallel with hands-on technical leadership, Thorsten plays an active role in industry standards and ecosystem coordination. He is deeply involved in the Trusted Computing Group (TCG), contributing to and advocating for specifications including Platform Certificates, RIM/FIM, DICE, and CyRes, and regularly works across silicon vendors, OEMs, IBVs, and open-source communities to drive alignment between standards and implementation.

With over 30 patents and a long track record of cross-organizational leadership, Thorsten brings both technical depth and governance experience to collaborative, multi-stakeholder initiatives.

## Value Added to ODP

Thorsten brings a pragmatic, ecosystem-oriented perspective to ODP, one grounded in shipping platforms, aligning stakeholders, and building trust across organizational boundaries.

He contributes experience in bridging standards, open-source reference work, and production firmware, helping ensure that ODP outputs are not only technically sound but also realistically adoptable by OEMs and silicon vendors. His background enables him to facilitate constructive dialogue between parties with differing constraints, incentives, and maturity levels, while keeping security, interoperability, and long-term maintainability as shared objectives.

Thorsten is motivated to help ODP mature into a respected, neutral coordination point for secure device firmware, where governance clarity, architectural coherence, and ecosystem credibility reinforce one another.

## Strategic Impact & Vision for ODP

Thorsten views ODP as uniquely positioned to raise the industry baseline for device firmware security and transparency at a time when platforms are becoming more diverse, more autonomous, and more tightly regulated.

Over his term, he would like to help ODP evolve along three strategic dimensions:

1. **Ecosystem-aligned reference direction**  
   Focus ODP efforts on a small number of clearly scoped reference architectures and patterns that serve as guidance anchors rather than exhaustive implementations, allowing downstream adopters flexibility while preserving interoperability.

2. **Clear service boundaries and governance signals**  
   Encourage well-documented OS–EC–firmware interaction models and governance practices that reduce ambiguity, improve auditability, and make collaboration across vendors easier.

3. **Supply-chain and attestation readiness**  
   Position ODP outputs so they naturally align with emerging attestation, provenance, and compliance expectations (e.g., RIM/FIM, platform certificates), without over-prescribing specific vendor solutions.

Thorsten’s strategic goal is for ODP to be recognized as a trusted convening body whose guidance helps organizations make better architectural decisions earlier—reducing fragmentation, risk, and reinvention across the ecosystem.


## Commitments & Outcomes (SMART, by end of term)

1. **Strategic Alignment & Direction**  
   Contribute to a concise ODP strategic alignment document that clarifies how projects, governance, and ecosystem engagement fit together.  
   *Success:* Published alignment artifact referenced by Steering Committee decisions and project planning.

2. **Architecture & Interface Guidance**  
   Help guide the development or review of at least one ODP reference architecture or interface guideline related to secure firmware or EC/OS interaction.  
   *Success:* Public document or repo with multi-stakeholder review and visible downstream interest.

3. **Standards & Ecosystem Bridging**  
   Act as a liaison between ODP and relevant standards bodies and partners to improve mutual awareness and alignment.  
   *Success:* Documented cross-references, joint discussions, or feedback loops influencing ODP work.

4. **Governance & Adoption Support**  
   Support Steering Committee activities that improve contributor clarity, onboarding, and decision transparency.  
   *Success:* Incremental governance improvements adopted without increasing process burden.

5. **External Representation**  
   Represent ODP perspectives in selected industry or partner forums when appropriate.  
   *Success:* Clear attribution to ODP and follow-up interest or engagement from attendees.
