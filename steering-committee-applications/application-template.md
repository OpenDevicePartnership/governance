# Open Device Partnership (ODP)
## Steering Committee Application

**Name • Title • Organization**  
**Contact (email / GitHub alias / LinkedIn)**  
**Proposed term** (e.g., Jan–Dec 2026)  
**Primary focus area(s)** (e.g., Patina, Secure EC firmware, OS-EC service interface, supply chain security, documentation & training, governance, partner engagement)

---


## What I bring

Brief summary that ties your background to ODP’s needs: specific skills, roles, tools, standards, or relationships.  
Include a short self‑introduction that highlights your background, personal or professional interests, and what motivates you to contribute.

**Examples (skills + self‑introduction):**

- **Example 1 (firmware & security):**  
  “I’m a platform firmware engineer with 12 years in UEFI and secure boot. I’ve led Secure Boot and Measured Boot efforts at two OEMs and enjoy mentoring early‑career engineers. I’m comfortable with Standalone MM patterns and threat modeling, and I’m excited to help ODP standardize memory‑safe reference subsystems.”

- **Example 2 (ecosystem & partnerships):**  
  “I’m a program manager with a background in OEM partnerships and developer ecosystems. I’ve organized multi‑vendor working groups and presented at industry forums. I’m interested in lowering onboarding friction for new contributors and growing ODP’s partner network.”

- **Example 3 (governance & community):**  
  “I’ve worked on open governance and contributor experience for three open‑source projects. I’m motivated by building inclusive processes and clear contributor paths. I’d bring experience in policy drafting, meeting facilitation, and community metrics.”

## Strategic Impact & Vision for ODP

Describe what about ODP most motivates you, the strategic areas you think ODP should prioritize, and how you’d like ODP to evolve over your term. Be concrete about the outcomes you expect to influence.

**Example:**
> I see ODP as the industry‑neutral bridge between silicon vendors, OEMs, and OS teams to raise the baseline for secure, memory‑safe platform firmware. I want ODP to evolve toward: (1) a small set of interoperable, memory‑safe reference subsystems; (2) a documented, auditable supply‑chain baseline; and (3) a clear contributor onboarding path that lowers barriers for OEMs/IFVs.

**Example:**
> My strategic impact will focus on standardizing Standalone MM patterns, expanding EC firmware reference implementations, and establishing a published audit policy for dependencies.

## Commitments & Outcomes (SMART, by the end of your term)

List **3–5** commitments you will drive this term. For each, state **what** you’ll do and **how success is measured**. You may choose any combination of areas; the items below are examples, not required fields.

- **North Star vision (example):**  
  Co‑develop a concise ODP “North Star” vision statement and a one‑page alignment guide, for the coming year, that explains how projects, governance, and community activities map to it.

- **Reference architecture (example):**  
  “Publish a Standalone MM reference design and two example modules by the end of my term; success = a public design doc, two reference repos with passing CI, and at least one downstream project demonstrating adoption.”

- **Ecosystem adoption (example):**  
  “Onboard one new OEM and two external maintainers by the end of my term; success = signed contributor agreements, ≥3 merged PRs from each, and a working demo build using their contributions.”

- **Security & supply chain (example):**  
  “Define and publish a dependency audit policy for core projects by the end of my term; success = policy in repo, CI scans enabled, and no critical findings for two consecutive quarters.”

- **Docs & training (example):**  
  “Create a ‘Getting Started with ODP’ workshop and record two sessions by the end of my term; success = ≥50 attendees total, ≥80% positive feedback, and a public step‑by‑step guide.”

- **Public representation (example):**  
  “Present ODP at two conferences or partner forums by the end of my term; success = accepted talks, published slides/recordings, and ≥10 new community signups or inquiries.”
