## Professional Background

Provide a brief professional background highlighting your relevant experience, technical expertise, and accomplishments.
Focus on specific roles, achievements, and skills that demonstrate your qualifications.

> **Note:** The examples below use a fictional candidate named "Applicant" to illustrate different backgrounds and
> approaches.

**Examples:**

- **Example 1 (firmware & security):**

  "Applicant is a platform firmware engineer with 12 years of experience in UEFI and secure boot implementations.
  Applicant has led Secure Boot and Measured Boot efforts at two major OEMs, architected TPM integration for enterprise
  platforms, and contributed to industry security standards working groups. Applicant holds expertise in Standalone MM
  patterns, threat modeling, and memory-safe system programming."

- **Example 2 (ecosystem & partnerships):**

  "Applicant is a program manager with 8 years of experience building developer ecosystems and OEM partnerships.
  Applicant has organized multi-vendor working groups involving 15+ companies, presented at UEFI Forum and industry
  conferences, and launched three successful open-source collaborations. Applicant's background includes technical
  project management, developer relations, and cross-organizational coordination."

- **Example 3 (governance & community):**

  "Applicant has 10 years of experience in open-source governance and community management across three major projects.
  Applicant has written governance policies for projects with 50+ contributors, facilitated stakeholder meetings across
  competing organizations, and established contributor onboarding programs that increased participation by 200%.
  Applicant's expertise includes policy drafting, consensus building, and metrics-driven community health."

## Value Added to ODP

Explain what specific value you bring to ODP and what motivates you to serve on the Steering Committee. Connect your
background to ODP's needs and describe how you will contribute to the partnership's mission and goals.

**Examples:**

- **Example 1 (firmware & security):**

  "Applicant is excited to help ODP standardize memory-safe reference subsystems that can be adopted across the
  industry. Applicant brings deep technical expertise in secure firmware architecture and a network of contacts across
  OEM security teams. Applicant is motivated by the opportunity to accelerate industry adoption of memory-safe firmware
  and establish ODP as the go-to resource for secure platform firmware."

- **Example 2 (ecosystem & partnerships):**

  "Applicant is interested in lowering onboarding friction for new contributors and growing ODP's partner network.
  Applicant brings proven expertise in developer ecosystem growth and relationships with key decision-makers at
  multiple OEMs and silicon vendors. Applicant is motivated to make ODP the industry-standard collaboration point for
  platform firmware and expand participation beyond early adopters."

- **Example 3 (governance & community):**

  "Applicant is motivated by building inclusive processes and clear contributor paths that enable diverse participation.
  Applicant brings experience establishing governance frameworks that balance technical rigor with accessibility.
  Applicant wants to help ODP scale its community while maintaining quality standards and ensuring all stakeholder
  voices are heard in decision-making."

## Strategic Impact & Vision for ODP

Describe what about ODP most motivates you, the strategic areas you think ODP should prioritize, and how you'd like ODP
to evolve over your term. Be concrete about the outcomes you expect to influence.

**Example:**

> Applicant sees ODP as the industry‑neutral bridge between silicon vendors, OEMs, and OS teams to raise the baseline
> for secure, memory‑safe platform firmware. Applicant wants ODP to evolve toward: (1) a small set of interoperable,
> memory‑safe reference subsystems; (2) a documented, auditable supply‑chain baseline; and (3) a clear contributor
> onboarding path that lowers barriers for OEMs/IFVs.

**Example:**

> Applicant's strategic impact will focus on standardizing Standalone MM patterns, expanding EC firmware reference
> implementations, and establishing a published audit policy for dependencies.

## Commitments & Outcomes (SMART, by the end of your term)

List **3–5** commitments you will drive this term. For each, state **what** you’ll do and **how success is measured**.
You may choose any combination of areas; the items below are examples, not required fields.

- **North Star vision (example):**

  Co‑develop a concise ODP “North Star” vision statement and a one‑page alignment guide, for the coming year, that
  explains how projects, governance, and community activities map to it.

- **Reference architecture (example):**

  “Publish a Standalone MM reference design and two example modules by the end of my term; success = a public design
  doc, two reference repos with passing CI, and at least one downstream project demonstrating adoption.”

- **Ecosystem adoption (example):**

  “Onboard one new OEM and two external maintainers by the end of my term; success = signed contributor agreements, ≥3
  merged PRs from each, and a working demo build using their contributions.”

- **Security & supply chain (example):**

  “Define and publish a dependency audit policy for core projects by the end of my term; success = policy in repo, CI
  scans enabled, and no critical findings for two consecutive quarters.”

- **Docs & training (example):**

  “Create a ‘Getting Started with ODP’ workshop and record two sessions by the end of my term; success = ≥50 attendees
  total, ≥80% positive feedback, and a public step‑by‑step guide.”

- **Public representation (example):**

  “Present ODP at two conferences or partner forums by the end of my term; success = accepted talks, published
  slides/recordings, and ≥10 new community signups or inquiries.”

> _(Feel free to replace the examples above with your own commitments — they can be technical, organizational, or
> outreach‑oriented.)_
