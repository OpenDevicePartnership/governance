# Open Device Partnership
## Governance Documentation & Request for Commments Process

The Open Device Partnership (ODP) is an alliance of industry-leading PC ecosystem partners in service of promoting secure, standards-guided, reusable, and trusted system software for client devices.

ODP organization-level governance is captured in the following documents:

- [Organization Charter](./CHARTER.md)
- [Code of Conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)
- [Trademark Policy](./TRADEMARKS.md)
- [Antitrust Policy](./ANTITRUST.md)

The ODP organization uses a Request for Comments (RFC) process to provide a consistent and controlled path for changes at both the broad organization level as well as at the individual project levels.  More information about the RFC process and how to engage in it can be found on the [RFC Process](./rfc/README.md) page.
