# Open Device Partnership (ODP) Governance Documentation & Request for Commments (RFC) Process

The ODP is an alliance of industry-leading PC ecosystem partners in service of promoting secure, standards-guided, reusable, and trusted system software for client devices.

ODP organization-level governance is captured in the following documents:

- [Organization Charter](./CHARTER.md)
- [Code of Conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)
- [Trademark Policy](./TRADEMARKS.md)
- [Antitrust Policy](./ANTITRUST.md)

The ODP organization uses a semi-formal RFC process to provide a consistent and controlled path for changes at both the organization and at the sub-project levels.  More information about the RFC process and how to engage in it can be found on the [RFC Process](./rfc/README.md) page.
