# Open Device Partnership Embedded Controller RFC Process

The Embedded Controller (EC) follows the same Request for Comments (RFC) process as the broader Open Device Partnership (ODP) ecosystem.

For EC specific changes, proposals, and discussions that do not need to bubble up to the ODP Steering Committee, the RFCs are managed within this folder.
